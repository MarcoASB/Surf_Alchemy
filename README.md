Climate Analysis for a holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii!

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

* Basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database with `Python` and `SQLAlchemy`.  
* Choose a start date and end date for the trip. Approximately 3-15 days total.
* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to the sqlite database.
* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.
